##Contents

This is a substantial rewrite of the source material, with many corrections. Links were added to some great BASH resources, as well as for individual commands. Any errors are mine alone, and all feedback is welcome.

##Intended Audience

I did this project to enforce my learning of BASH and Ubuntu Linux in general. There are many online references that far exceed the value of this file, but this can be printed double-sided and put in a folder to take to school or a class.
